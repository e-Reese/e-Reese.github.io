          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Divvy, Chicago’s leading bike-share service, has become a vital part of the city’s mobility and leisure landscape. While thousands of riders take advantage of the system every year, the challenge lies in converting casual riders—those who use the service occasionally—into annual members. 
            By analyzing ride data from 2023-2024, we can uncover patterns in rider behavior and build targeted marketing strategies to encourage long-term engagement.

        <section id="executive-summary">
          <h2>Objective</h2>
          <p>
          The primary goal of this strategy is to identify ways to transform casual Divvy cyclists into committed annual members. Using ride history data, we can examine when, how, what, and where people ride, then apply those insights to design effective outreach campaigns.
