# Raspberry Pi Travel Router Tutorial Website

This is a tutorial website documenting how I built a travel router/wifi relay using a Raspberry Pi. The website is designed with a Medium-like blog style to provide a clean reading experience.

## Project Overview

This website serves as a comprehensive guide for building your own travel router using a Raspberry Pi. It covers:

- Hardware components and setup
- Software installation and configuration (OpenWrt)
- Network configuration for dual Wi-Fi interfaces
- Advanced features like VPN integration and ad-blocking
- Practical usage scenarios and tips

### Roadmap / Future Enhancements
- Automatic VPN Routing
- Guest Portal Automation (Selenium?)
- Custom 18650 Battery Source

## Website Structure

The website is built with plain HTML and CSS, focusing on readability and a clean design:

- `index.html` - Main tutorial page with step-by-step instructions
- `styles.css` - CSS styling for Medium-like appearance
- `images/` - Directory containing tutorial images and diagrams

## Development

To work on this website locally:

1. Clone this repository
